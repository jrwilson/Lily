I started developing the kernel with the tutorial at http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones
I decided to create ISO images for testing with Bochs.
The code for doing this can be found in the Makefile.
I also developed two functions for printing strings and numbers in hex.
These functions were inspired by the tutorial at http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/3.-The%20Screen.html

Added code to display a message and halt when there is multiboot error.
Added code to halt the processor at the end of the kernel.
Decided to use a higher-half kernel using the GDT trick described at http://wiki.osdev.org/Higher_Half_With_GDT
