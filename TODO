Kernel
======
Fix kpanic's with TODO
Handle spurious interrupts
Exit/destroy race condition
Refactor kernel logging framework (vga and/or serial)
Fix kassert (1. enter text mode 2. print 3. halt)
Add time to scheduler

Automata
========
Hardware detection
Graphical shell
Thread-like abstraction for request-response
Network card driver
disk driver
editor
development environment
improve text shell
Make the keyboard more robust (i.e., what if we hit a key before initialization)
Drivers should probe hardware
Factor out bind to syslog
Factor out bind to vfs
subscribe to mounted file system
subscribe to vfs client
High-level bind using string names



Rethink the file system.
In most operating systems, there is one virtual file system that federates a number of virtual and physical file systems.
The file system is consistent for each process, i.e., /bin/sh is the same for all processes.
This consistency facilitates IPC and other conventions, e.g., the working directory.

Plan9 allows processes to alter their view of the file system similar to altering a memory map in traditional micro-kernels.

Thus, we should admit the possibility that each automaton might want to build its own virtual file system.
Alternatively, automata could share filesystem automata for a shared experience.
Either way, these are ideas that need to be explored.
